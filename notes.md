Linkterceptor Notes:=============Interface Inspired by:-----------------------*	MetroTwit*	http://craigmod.com/journal/subcompact_publishing/*	"The Magazine" as described above. What we want?----------------*	For the action to either be a modulus  or pull-from-bottom action on-click.*	To be able to 'Send Link To' an easily extendable set of services, starting with Instapaper, Delicious and ReadItLater. *	To see a small image, if any such image is available. *	To see the title. *	To see a preview of the text.*	To allow the user to turn the functionality off and have the site remember that it was turned off. What should we consider?-----------------------------*	Displaying social proof.*	Allowing the user to set the preview text themselves. What should it absolutely not do?--------------------------------------*	Make us wait.*	Use mouseover, because it's not particularly future-safe and because it is generally terribleWhat is our critical path?----------------------------1.	Intercept clicks on external links. 2.	Create a design element based on intercepted click.3.	Get source Title on click.4.	Get source content-preview on click.5.	Read It Later button.6.	Get source image on link.7.	Capture external information so it doesn't have to constantly be grabbed.8.	Recognize user preference on/off.9.	Build a good failure state. 10.	Isolate links to only those within main content.
